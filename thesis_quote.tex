\noindent Nim Chimpsky (November 19, 1973 â€“ March 10, 2000) was a chimpanzee who was the subject of an extended study of animal language acquisition at Columbia University, led by Herbert S. Terrace, as a challenge to Chomsky's thesis that full-fledged language use was innate only to humans. This quote is the Nim's longest recorded sentence.
