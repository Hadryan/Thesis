\todo{write the Conclusion after the introduction is finalized.}

Human are capable of uncovering the underlying concepts, relations, and structure of sparsely observed data with variable quality and use that knowledge to go far beyond the paucity of the data.

For instance, a child has the ability to produce an infinite number of new sentences by composing sparely observed words~\citep{lake2017building} or generalize the concept of ``penguin'' from a single picture in a book~\citep{vinyals2016matching}.
